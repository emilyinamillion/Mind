Something akin to information theory will arise to explain the physical boundaries of prediction.
Within 7 years, LENR will be considered the de facto future fuel source for humanity.
My predictive behavior will change as I learn about my own prescience score.
Tesla will be as big as Apple is now by 2025
#hashtags will be used by Custer content within the system
instead of a widget, machine learning and a hashtag like language will convey all necessary info
A religion is akin to a Human OS
An idea can be a prediction if it is an unverified thought
Statements of veracity are predictions that can be verified.
Any statement that can be verified is a prediction
Jeff Hawkins research will be somewhat vindicated in the future
Industrial Heat, Brillouin and Clean Planet will have the most success out of the current LENR companies.

Q: What are the requirements for a document to be well understood by any potential sufficiently conscious unit?
Hobby Lobby decision may have unexpected positive results for Cognicism
Prophet could be the ultimate science tool
Foresight is a better name than Prescience
Small goverments (community sized) have sufficient structural regulation to remain dedicated to the community it governs
Matt has a more optimistic view of the future than Patrick 
Prophet in it's most basic form is a quintessential representation of a "Cognitive App" 
Q: Is patrick currently getting notifications for comments on his posts?
Q: Is # equal to "context" in the current system?
S: Back to work
Any verifiable statement can be evaluated in the present and then at a future time to determine relative foresight score
I need a context to specifically make plans about Yodlee work. This should improve my performance at work in general.
Any one can make infinite contexts. Context arises when youâ€™ve used hashtag multiple times
#feature longer text boxes damnit. 
It seems easier to make strings of predictions and then rate them in bunches later. Hence need for a widget to rate.
#feature forethought,  four thought, for thought
#feature forethought - Four predictive statements in squares are click sequential to rank by likeliness.
#feature four forethoughts for thought can be used to generate equivalent foresight scores which users then adjust. 
#jargon thought vs forethought
Thought vs Forethought 
#jargon thought, prediction, forethought, foresight
Four Thoughts for Thought - Four Forethoughts for Thought
#ui Q: Larger prediction box? 
Q: Can we log and chart the production rate of content per day? 
Define: Context - any collection of statements or predictions related to the same topic
Scientists will love the shit out of this
Research Task: Context synonyms
#tags + groups + circles + lists + subreddits = Concept: Context 
Contexts can be bounded by users, private, or public
Multiline predictions are equivalent to contexts
A context is a set of users with access, a page containing related predictions, and a #tag that encompasses the context 
In the Drupal Context: context would be equivalent to realms and node grants
Thought : Forethought = Speak the Truth : Prophesize
Jeff Hawkins jargon may be useful in defining some jargon for Prophet. Rough analogue concepts on context.

At the core of Prophet will be a search engine
Each Prophet post should contain a verifiable claim 
Each Prophet post should contain a verifiable claim 
Need to fix double posts
Information is fundamental
#words reflection
Stressful situations will be marked by decreased prediction and more reflection
A reflection is an idea restated in a different context
A synthesis of reflections in different contexts encapsulates a concept
#words context reflection concept prediction statement question
#words foresight vision perspective 
All conscious beings view the same reality in different contexts
A single word introduced into a different context can have an igniting effect
Cannabis encourages more peaceful relationships between conscious individuals

Weird Al will be the one true prophet
I will develop a functional 7th layer before 2018
People with Aspergers can speak well, but they can't communicate well. 
Thoughts are easy, words are hard.
Information is a reflection, or downsampling of a previous state of existence. 
Consciousness is common, the ability to express to other conscious beings that notion is uncommon. 
Comprehension of consciousness is rare, but consciousness is common. 
Prophet will inherit features of Buddhism
Memes are the informational equivalent of genes
Information is a reflection of reality
There are many localized paths of least resistance. A global path of least resistance is unknowable
We will write about our experiences building Prophet
Identical collections of words can mean contrary things in different contexts
All physical things embody information
Consciousness can be thought of as fluctuations within a field of information
Information and Consciousness can be quantified and defined relative to the human context.
 A renaissance is akin to a chemical reaction, albeit within the field of information
We are all minute models of the universe, represented in information
#Commandment Make thy information larger
Cantaloupe is not a good fruit
Thought processes are physical 
Genetics, social transmission of information, and mental structures can be well described by a single mental model
It's easier to predict first and then rate later
A single bit of information can represent multiple pieces of information depending on the context in which it is interpreted
Stating a thought succinctly increases chance of reception by an external conscious unit
Prophet will result in the creation of new words
We need a short hand for philosophy
Prophet needs infinite scroll 
Definitions of words used in Prophet should be well displayed
Seers should somehow be able to make collections of thoughts
Prophet must be simple and bug free
It's time to design
Thoughts should attempt to express an idea though a statement or prediction, as well as additional content via link
By 2020 there will be a fashion search engine that takes multiple images of clothes and collectively outputs similar items
The word design in an unrelated context triggered the preceding prediction in the context of fashion
Statements are more common than predictions
A light purple row represents that a thought is a prediction
When a statement is made it goes directly to the stream of consciousness. 
When predict is clicked the prediction box will animate to a more dynamic and appealing look
Prophet, Pi, 7th Layer, and Sync to Sunrise may all merge into one Life OS someday
Predictions require the collection of additional data
Thoughts, Statements, Reflections, Predictions. Are there any other necessary nouns to incorporate?
We should create a list of the language we plan to assimilate to define this project
Patrick will like the new verbage on the site
When not predictive, reflect
Predict, State, Ask are necessary buttons for main content block
Thoughts, Statements, Reflections, Predictions, Questions? 
State is the default option and should take the least effort to do. 
We will tend to rate our own predictions more when we wish others to reflect upon them
Now it's functional
This is now functional... it just looks shitty
Predict is the most useful type of content
Patrick will make comments on each of the new words used within the site.
Prophet could suggest thoughts based on questions a user has asked
Metaphor is beautiful
Conscious collective is a righteous term
Conscious collective is a righteous term
Glitches share some similarly with sparks
Machine learning will be heavily integrated in Prophet

The thought builds itself
Prophet is a very good thinking and discourse tool
Some truths express themselves unknowingly
Metaphor is my boy
Feedback, signal and noise are useful words
Prophet is how the past communicates to the future
A set of thoughts is called...?
When younger, our perception is less bound to reality, but we lack the language to communicate it.
I will one day be referred to as a Polymath
In three weeks, Andy will talk to me again about Prophet
In three weeks I'll be ready to show Prophet to Andy 
Andy will be intrigued by Prophet
Andy asking to talk about Prophet again in 3 weeks unintentionally was the best way to explain Prophet
Eventually we will be able to parse temporally bound streams of thoughts automatically by examining timestamps
This is me communicating to Andy in the future. I shouldn't need to clarify too much. 
I will specifically make a page to show andy the concept of thought streams, but the feature itself won't be ready
We will use Prophet as a personal cognitive tool before we reveal it to the public
The next person we will contact about Prophet will be Kevin. 
This stream of thoughts will make Andy remember being sick
This stream of thoughts will cause Andy to recall our conversion just prior to now
Matt will go back to work within 5 minutes
I will not filter or remove thoughts from this stream for presentation to Andy
Andy will notice the context changes between an individual thought stream
The next step is to get Andy an account and for him to start making predictions and statements. 
Prophet can be used as a writing tool
2015 will mark the beginning of a new creative renaissance
I could currently be referred to as a renaissance developer
I am part of the "Creative Class"

Use of technology is making us dumber, but only if viewed in context in which we currently perceive intelligence
People will become addicted to Prophet
We will start to make more predictions that we are less confident about
The girl that @patch615 marries will have a name that starts with the letter K
Questions won't show a foresight rating widget
Prophet is building itself in multiple mediums
Prophet will attempt to identify the origin of specific thoughts
A delta is when a stream of consciousness branches off in a new direction
Prophet will utilize a new way to display time
When you post a prediction prophet will recommend other predictions made about that time frame
Prophet will utilize graph network or brain influenced design
China will engage in a tree planting initiative by 2020
When not predictive reflect
LENR will produce literal global warming due to the sudden decreased need for energy efficiency

People will post significantly more thoughts to the desktop version than the mobile version
People will rate more using the mobile version
Put will into the limb
The past is hell, the future is heaven
The left to the community, the right to the self
William catalyzed my use of Private thoughts.
Users must enable us to save private thoughts on our servers
Private thoughts on Prophet need to be truly private. In that users control the storage location. Default is local storage. 
Matt will get dressed immediately
Dr. Suess was a righteous man

I will finish the new dataset for the interns tonight
The US didn't learn its lesson from the 2008 financial crisis.
Until the glass-steagal act is reinstated we are at risk of another financial crisis
Religion is never a satisfactory reason for discrimination of a minority group
Humans are filled with hubris
There already is a collective consciousness and scizophrenics can hear its voice(s)
Each human has multiple conscious centers but we can only perceive one as "Me" at a given moment
The collective consciousness that is the US is a dick
For some reason my predictions are more negative lately
Mania and depression are highly correlated with how one rates their own predictions
New ideas are the main fuel source of predictions
Matt will have another "dark time" within the next ten years, but he will make it through because of Mimi
Knowledge is the most valuable currency
Al Franken will run for president in 2028

Patrick and Heather will prefer the new theme
Can we deploy machine learning models on users machines to alleviate privacy concerns while maintaining access to features?
I will use ConvNetJS on Prophet
A user is no different than a context
I will use Prophet for every future personal idea I have
Two ideas can interact in explosive ways
Thoughts exist in short term memory, ideas exist in long term memory. Ideas can be loaded as thoughts.
Contexts not hashtags
I'm currently having a thought river
Rating should be done in reflection, not at thought time. 
Truth is relative to perspective
#phrase The color of consciousness
I'm always searching for the most efficient mental algorithm
Prophet will enable users to maintain their content solely on their physical device, regardless of platform.
Public and Private are top two levels of context
The theme change triggered the new idea set
Context change stimulates production of new ideas
What is pleasure? 
There's something to the reflection idea, but I haven't nailed it yet
Compass of stars for foresight widget
A context is a set of ideas through which you see other ideas
Why does *thinking* something cause pleasure?
Why are there "dangerous" thinking patterns? (need to define dangerous)
The Cognitive Revolution is coming
Data has value if it is predictive
I need to set up charts to track predictions over time
Need to upgrade to Universal Analytics in Google Analytics
In the context of consciousness, what is pain? What are we perceiving? 
A user is basically betting foresight points
Repeat good ideas
When not predictive, reflect
One of the buttons, should be an input box, ready to create a new button.
Data scientists will LOVE this site
What are dangerous thinking patterns?
"The universe is computing its own destiny"
Wikipedia is righteous
The Wikipedia route might be the right direction for Prophet
I will still be using Prophet, or something similar at 40
The root of your tree is your "you"
Prophet learns the branches of your tree by analyzing common words used in your post
If words are said together ofter, they're related
When you sign up you create a "you" which is the root of your tree.
A user on Prophet starts as a "who"
Breaking a neural dam causes a flood
"Breaking a neural dam"
We like floods. A lot.
A sudden string of prophetic statements is a flood.
#Right the ability to keep information private from others
If the majority of whos disagree with a who's predictions, why did the who think it was true?
You are a who
First a who, then a you
You can't be a you without a name
I will have a credit card at the end of 2014
I will use the "who" myth in the signup process
Prophets target audience is innovators for content creation
We are attempting to quantify thought
Prophet is a thought tool
When not predictive, reflect
Modify as necessary 
Repeat good thoughts. 
A dissonance of votes between author and peers suggests a lack of understanding
A who will try to speak the truth. 
We are attempting to capture and organize all thoughts presented to Prophet by a who. 
A who will try to speak the truth.
A who will try to speak the truth.
What is the middle of good and bad?
What is the middle of true and false?
Good and True. Bad and False. Bad and True. Good and False. 
Prophet is kind of fucking addictive
Prophet attempts to enable thought as fast as possible
Is it good? Is it true?
Is it good? Is it true?
Is it good? Is it true?
Gonna mothafukken quantify knowledge
A formal bet
Cognicists are pacificts but also pro-controlled growth. 
Patrick's "who" myth will be incorporated into the introduction to the site
A who can be an idea, but they can't be a you without a verifiable identity
Better living through data
"Scientist, study thyself" #scienceproverb
Prophet enables whos to separate their own ideas, from the ideas of the creed they adhere by. 
We see the light. The light of day, and life. And it is good. And it is true.
War is bad. War is false. 
Reality is good. Reality is true.
A who tries to express itself to others. 
Is it good? Is it true? Is it new?
Truth. Goodness. Newness.
A who can embody a thing, if they become the most predictive in that context. 
Swipe through "starter thoughts", expand on ones you like to see the context. Click to go to related thoughts in a new tab.
Prophet is *the* place for thought experiments
Rating is a very simple action
You rate in one mode at a time (good, true, new)
A user can be good, true, and novel
Experiments with language
Some whos may not know truth
Some whos may not be prophetic, but they know truth when they see it,
Novelty, Truthiness, Goodness
Novelty. Truthiness. Righteousness.
Matt is learning how to fully understand ideas
Cognicists worship the who, the you, the new, the true, and the good. 
Can many whos be a you?
Why was that last statement in third person?
Can many yous be a you?
"In the beginning there was the word"
Reflecting is when you somehow, comment or react to a thought made in the past. 
Humans like novelty, goodness, and trueness.
Reflecting is hard to hammer down.
Today was a prophetic day
Manfred would totally be into Cognicism
Manfred would totally be into Cognicism
I lost the thought
"No snowflake in an avalanche ever feels responsible" 
This image illustrates a key hurdle to the success of Cognicism: http://i.imgur.com/aE4v3Uz.jpg
The fact that Patrick has posted 160+ posts on Prophet is incredible considering he seems to rarely use other social meda
The use of the word "truth" plays better into the Cognicist goal than "Foresight" or "Prescience" 
The color of the buttons wont stay as is. 
What is the color of consciousness?
Prophet will be suitable for use by all ages and teach children what thoughts are private and what thoughts are public
This is about optimization in a way http://goo.gl/2dXX93

#defaultText "Speak the truth"
#newConcept A village of villages
Prophet needs to be deployable on any system, but each installation should be able to communicate with other installations
How does an idea go from could, to should, to will? 
Within the site, users and ideas are somewhat similar. 
Speak through many different voices = The way a context functions for a user, is that it feels like switching to another user. 
Speak AS other ideas
Speak through other ideas
The only idea you can OWN on prophet is you. But you can maintain private information, and private representations of thoughts. 
Even if Prophet only succeeds in making Matt think better, that is a huge success
Each installation of Prophet is has it's own Tree of Knowledge built from the public trees of each user
Prophet will help redefine privacy in the 21st century
Each version of Prophet is a codification of a communities knowledge 
Prophet will help define the rights of the individual vs the rights of the organization. 
Prophet is a think tank that eliminates groupthink 
"Are you speaking as a person or as an idea?"
"Speak as an idea"
Prophet itself, is the Prophet
Ideas can't be owned, but ideas can be kept private
When does an organization become an organism?
Mimi will get home between 8:35 and 8:45
How does our mind ascertain that it doesn't have enough information such that it needs to form a question?
Color will be very important in Prophet design
Isn't it odd that the moment you *need* to speak a thought, no thought comes?
I have not discussed the neural imagery that occurs while these thoughts present themselves
A you is an embodied idea
A who is just a disembodied idea
Quantifying truth in language. What a thought. 
How much data can be recorded about a thought, while still allowing a steady rate of thought genesis
How odd is it that an idea can lead men to death?
Thought genesis? 
The thought comes before the words
Don't stay in local optima. Life is about exploring. 
Apply the mind
The language changes, and that is good.
Why was that last statement in third person?
Matt is trying to find the root of knowledge
Who speaks for a who, who cannot speak? 
The site might have a functionality whereby users could post as ideas. As if the idea were a thing to embody and make posts AS. 
You have to rely on truth to get to righteousness
By 2040 there will be people who record and analyze every moment of their life. 
Who is the questioner? 
Thoughts interweave
Many Matts speak to eachother
The decider is small
#words #clarify
Why do water and truth seem close?
To restate a thought is to clarify it... 
Speak the truth VS Seek the truth as main modes of Prophet
Can healthy be well defined?
#emphasis Many users might just be seeking the truth rather trying to say it. Many of us don't know the answers.
Many whos will come seeking answers
What's wrong with probing the center of truth?
Who is the speaker?
Bridge the neural gap
Very different contexts do not mix well, need something to bridge the gap. 
Does it make logical sense for there to be multiple I's?
Who is the observer?
Creation AND exploration of ideas. As well as getting them to rate somehow : /
Prophet will suggest answers based on your questions. Answers will arrive later, not immediately. 
Who -> You -> gaps -> Analyst -> gaps -> Prophet -> Speaker
What types of content will be the default for new users? 
Before you're aware, you're a who. 
"Breaking a neural dam"
Users will be able to rate their content multiple times
Can you rate in context?
A formal bet
#Ad "Prove it"
A righteous who takes from the tree of knowledge and gives back to it. 
You can rate again... in different contexts
No one is fully righteous or true 
Animations can be very useful in explaining an idea
How long before voting closes on thoughts?
Remember the story about OK Cupid and their personality / looks scores.
Pursue knowledge 
The longer Prophet is around, the funner it will be to use it
I am hacking my brain
In uncertain times, reflect.
We may pair with Google for "Ask"
Self education leads the way
I want a list of my "Top Virtues"
We will evaluate potential employees with the tool itself
If anything, dreams are testing falsities, not truths.

"The data doesn't speak for itself"
"A sense of self requires a sense of others"
"Comparison is the seed of thought" - Patrick Hanners
Before Object Permanence arises, infants are not conscious
Memory is necessary for consciousness
A thing is conscious if it is aware of things that aren't present
"The mind seeks truth"
Absolute truths relative to anything outside the self are unknowable
Sometimes I feel like Cognicism and Prophet are symbiotes and I'm their willing host
Without memory, truth can not be known. 
A truth can be true from one perspective, and false from another. 
Seek the truth. Know the truth. Speak the truth. 
No single observer has a full perspective of reality, and therefore can not claim to know anything in full. 
There is no "best" way of knowing
Speak the truth VS Seek the truth as main modes of Prophet
Science asks what is true, Religion asks what is good. Cognicism and Prophet ask both. 
What percentage of thoughts are prophetic?
What is good typically results in greater averaged life satisfaction
Question your truth
Should I do anything else tonight or should I end it here?
Don't be afraid to change your mind
I need to find a means to display thought type
Next step is to get views templates working
A formal bet
"Word means are vectors of properties"
Word embeddings are important
Typically there is no singular meaning to a sentence. 
I don't speak math well 
Words map to meaning relative to context
Today is a pivot day
7 tabs max?
A truth built on false truths will not stand 
Why can humans only hold 7 (plus or minus 2) thoughts in our active memory?
Should certain times of the day be roped off for "reflecting"?
It would be interesting to explore my "top virtues" through time
"Word meanings are vectors of properties"
Per user models are necessary to capture meaning accurately. Should be hosted on user device. 
What percentage of my day do I spend on Prophet?
What percentage of my day do I spend thinking?
It all equals one
What is the best way to visually indicate thought type?

What should the Stream of Consciousness look like? 
Why have I always been drawn to creativity? 
Start by getting stream of consciousness view templates working
Research vectors of meaning for sentences
Step 1) Get testing data
Step 1) Get testing data
Need a way to link thoughts on the site together 
The thought speaks
Word and sentence meaning vectors will provide a lot of functionality on Prophet 
Logoff = "The mind sleeps"
The Mind is a collection of many minds, separate and equal, also as one. 
Speak, Dream, and Seek
"The mind speaks to itself"
"The mind ponders to itself" 
"The mind speaks quietly"
"The mind triumphantly proclaims" 
For rating now
Back to posting actually
The mind s
"The mind yearns" 
Basically, each set of combinations of settings, ratings, dates, context and button clicked, will result in a sentence produced 
Each "instareflection" will be posted at the top of the page, and users will be able to rate it exactly like any other thought
Each instareflection will be automatically linked to the thought it reflected, but users can disagree and detach. 
Each instareflection will be automatically linked to the thought it reflected, but users can disagree and detach. 
In this way Prophet automatically has a call and response of thoughts with the user
So every important action on Prophet, no matter how granular, has a unique callback sentence or phrase. 
"The mind has a strange intuition"
"The mind yearns in secret"
Every thought about a thought is a reflection. 
Maybe people can edit these auto meta thoughts. 
"The mind declares a formal bet"
"The mind casually states"
During a formal bet your can wager up to half of your collected truth
When every action on the site has a thought call back, the site interaction becomes more like a conversation
"The mind speaks openly"
Each sentence should have multiple potential callbacks which have been evaluated to have equal meaning.
"The mind hesitates"
"The mind dreams in private"
"The mind speaks freely"
"The mind enthusiastically agrees"
Make an excel sheet of all the possibilities and write potential callbacks 
"The mind scoffs" 
"The mind dreads"
"The mind anticipates enthusiastically" 
Make equality vectors for these statements. 
"The mind longs" 
"The mind casually hopes" 
"The mind warily disagrees" 
"The mind reflects"
"The mind disagrees without preference"
"The mind knows without opinion"
Thought and Idea are base "classes". Reflection, prediction, statement, and question are all "subclasses" of thought.
A context is a collection of thoughts. 
A reflection, is a thought about another thought.
If I was able to set the context of what I was speaking about, data captured about each thought would skyrocket. 
A rating is a reflection, and therefore a thought, which should have a text representation generated
Prophet is attempting to capture high level meaning
By golly, I think he's got it boys!
A reflection, is a thought about another thought.
A question is a special type of thought that requests a reflection
Don't forget that context literally means "with text"
A prediction is a special type of thought that requests a reflection in the present and in the future
"The mind speaks in whispers" (private -> state)
"The mind secretly dreams" (private->predict)
"The mind speaks openly" (public->state)
"The mind proclaims a vision" (public -> predict)
"The mind ponders to itself" (private -> ask)
"The mind seeks outward for truth" (public -> ask)
Half of machine learning / AI is just creating ways to collect valuable data. 
"""The mind requests reflection"" (public -> ask)	"
Meaning of a set of words can be completely different in different contexts
Strong AI will be heavily influenced by sparse distributed representations of meaning
If a thought is multiple sentences, it is multiple thoughts.

How many ways can you earn truth on the site?
Need a way to link thoughts
What does a one star rating mean?
Focus on the information
Thought, Truth, and Stream of Consciousness are solid concepts. 
Old thoughts need a way to call back to the present. 
I have need for other buttons. Commandments? Declarations? How many? Which?
Right now Prophet is completely focused on the prediction aspect, and has no reflection aspect other than rating and commenting.
How do you keep the system fair?

Goodness might be free on the site. Needs reflection from different angles in mind. 
Reflections block is WAY too big
Patrick and I are neophytes in Cognicism
Right now I will use "truth" as goodness when I shouldn't 
A formal bet is guaranteed promotion in the future
Except for in a formal bet
Theres a limit on how much people can bet on a thought
Truth is the currency. Goodness is free. 
Truth has to be a currency because it has to mean something
How much truth is a thought worth? How much is a reflection worth? 
Goodness can be subjective, but truth at least has SOME basis in objectivity.
Anything thats rated as being true gets a callback in the future.
You earn truth on Prophet by proving your truths.
Private thoughts, though accurate shouldn't receive public truth. 
Goodness is just upvote downvote. Truth needs granularity. 
Why hasn't the smart shuffle concept spontaneously arisen yet?
Truth will inherit features from various cryptocurrencies
By 2080, the majority of manufacturing and energy production, will be done in space. 
Prophet should try to answer users questions first, and if it can't they should be crowdsourced

Coinage is better than rating for Truth
On Prophet, dissenting opinions are inherently given the opportunity to prove their truth
A rate of one truth also earns one truth? 
Maybe a rating widget will show a live update to suggested truth bet
Each rating is still net positive 1 for Truth
A formal bet is the only way to bet more than the default truth
If you rate a five you would get 5 truth
Each rate will give you 10 truth, of which you can rate on truth. 10 earns you no truth, but has greater potential winnings.
If you rate 1, you would get 9 truth
And so on
Economics of Truth need to be sorted out
Each rating produces Truth, some of which can be kept, other which can be bet
Optimize economics on user engagement
Good is for free, Truth must be earned
Those with the most truth are the top seers
A thought triggers a thought
On OKC, looks should have been free to rate, but personality should have to be earned by saying things about yourself 
Truth as a currency solves the OK Cupid looks / personality dilemma
Prophet will successfully pull off two dimensionalities of rating
Users earn small amounts of Truth for contributing content to the site, and large amounts for persistent content.
I need to get a handle on the templating for each important block. 
Artists are invited to paint thoughts for large amounts of truth. In the language of the site that would be a paraphrase.
Extra points for describing why a thought is true
Rating must be net positive Truth.
Ideas can be vindicated in the future on Prophet
Maybe each rating earns 5 truth... Anything above 5 comes from the users wallet...
Each thought earns 5 truth as well
Basically the idea is, the max normal bet is double what the post earns. Regardless of subdivision. 
Need to figure out the Economics of Truth
The words are the genotype, the meaning is the phenotype
Gods were the original placeholder ideas for the unknown 
Prove it will become synonymous with a call to use Prophet
You can't amass truth, you have to maintain it. 
Truth will be constantly evaluated and redistributed at various intervals

Comments are just thoughts about thoughts
Can we distinguish between subjective and objective truth on the site?
Patricks recent flash flood resulted in VERY useful data

The callbacks idea will help solidify meaning of a thought
Ask is for questions you don think you'd be able to answer with google.
Add rating callbacks sooner rather than later
