We have a device giving heat energy compatible with nuclear transformations, but it operates at low energy and gives neither nuclear radioactive waste nor emits radiation. From basic general knowledge in nuclear physics this should not be possible. Nevertheless we have to relate to the fact that the experimental results from our test show heat production beyond chemical burning, and that the E-Cat fuel undergoes nuclear transformations. It is certainly most unsatisfying that these results so far have no convincing theoretical explanation, but the experimental results cannot be dismissed or ignored just because of lack of theoretical understanding.”</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, October 8, 2014 at 11:46am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens shared a link.<div class="comment">LENR / Cold Fusion confirmed today...

Reality is permanence. It&#039;s just what we perceive as persisting. 

Thought Experiment: 
Raise a child in a closed environment, introduce falsities into this environment that are persistent. Ie, the sun rises and falls every four hours, gravity is reverse, the year is 1982, some real Truman Show type stuff.  Because that child is unaware of anything beyond that environment, what they view as reality is that existence. I even imagine if you introduced altered physics the child would still know it to be reality. Because it is A reality. Not THE reality, because you can&#039;t know the entirety of such a thing, but a vision of reality. A distorted one.

Conclusion: 
We all have a different version or vision of reality. And the way we define it is by permanence. What other way is there to assess such a thing?

Knowing this, there is also the realm of the mind to be explored. Whether it be through contemplation, meditation, drugs, or lucid dreaming, it is a similar reality to be explored. In fact we mostly dream unaware of the fact that we&#039;re dreaming. So it too can be perceived as a type of reality with rules and order that can be evaluated. 

The odd thing about this mental reality, is that it too has persistent physical rules. Take a lucid dream for example, why are there persistent realities such as the inability to look at hands or a clock without them distorting? What permanence arises through evaluation of the mental landscape?

Proposition: 
Scientists of the Mind. People who lucid dream, or achieve said state by other means, and then use the scientific method to establish the physical boundaries of the mind. People who explore this mental reality and establish if it does have consistent and measurable rules.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, August 28, 2014 at 3:08pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens posted something via YouTube.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 27, 2014 at 10:01am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens shared a link.<div class="comment">Sigh.

Isotope samples are being done, as well as continuing analysis of the 6 months of data collected.

This has unfortunately pushed back the release of the report until September, but I think as more people get involved, they feel more confident in being able to make this a big deal which would be a very good thing for the field. Hence the extra time to do isotope sample analysis, now that it appears the data supporting anomalous (nuclear level) heat production is very strong. 

Remember this is actually the second report. The first report, though done with a very high level of control and precision, raised some concerns from the community at large. I honestly thought the first report was bullet proof, they were extraordinarily conservative with their estimates and still produced incredible levels of excess heat. But the scientific community is unfortunately very closed off to progress. 

This report will be a big deal. And as days pass, it&#039;s getting harder and harder to deny the coming energy revolution. Not years, but months. Insane.

I think this is exactly what they intended to do. They revitalized motorola. They weren&#039;t putting out anything unique. Now they have 3 flagship products unlike any other phone company: Moto X, Moto 360, and Project Ara.

I think that Google wanted a solid company that was devoted to developing products for Android Wear. Google has consistently done things that might not benefit them directly, but definitely benefit them indirectly. 

Google still has access to any patents that Motorola produces. Essentially Motorola is now an isolated self sustaining creative studio that will continue to have a strong relationship with Google and therefore benefit Google.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, April 29, 2014 at 8:29am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens posted something via YouTube.<div class="comment">Fascinating.

It was actually pretty good. Ashton did a surprisingly good job portraying Jobs. Ashton has always had this problem where his voice is too distinct to allow you to escape into a film and see him fully as a character.

That being said, there was a lot of subtlety in his mannerisms, and you could tell that he had taken a great amount of time studying the way Steve Jobs moved and how his energy level rose and fell as he communicated. 

I think he did a great job with the opportunity to portray Jobs. Obviously if the Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher, Christian Bale film comes to fruition this would pale in comparison, but I think they did a great job with the resources they had.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, April 6, 2014 at 5:23pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">&quot;We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living.

In this video,  a woman is hearing for the first time in her life due to a cochlear implant.

Can you imagine in the future, that humans could create NEW senses that plug directly into our brains? Perhaps something that sees ultraviolet light, or innate understanding of math due to a chip that allows your brain to directly interface with a calculator.

When we plugged into those artificial senses I imagine we would feel the same overwhelming sense of understanding that this woman is having. Look how she immediately understands the concepts of high and low in terms of pitch. How amazing would to experience the world as if it was new all over again. Like your were a child, naive to the world. 

I imagine gaining a new sense would feel someone akin to a heightened sense of awareness. To perceive in a brand new way would be unfathomable. And I imagine it would be beautiful.

Honestly the video speaks for itself.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 26, 2014 at 10:07pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve played my last show.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 26, 2014 at 7:53pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens posted something via YouTube.<div class="comment">Apparently Jason Mraz was in Rohnert Park recently.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, March 26, 2014 at 11:20am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Facebook is a shit company.

Google really gets it though. Newest item? For Valentines day they auto detect pictures where people are kissing and add hearts to the image and turn it into an animated gif. 

Though it&#039;s kind of silly it&#039;s mind boggling the tech that we have already to achieve this.

Object detection was one thing but something like a kiss is more abstract. It&#039;s almost verb detection. Incredibly impressive if you ask me.

1) Complete sync between devices. You should and will be able to easily access content from any one device from another. 

2) Internet of things. This builds off of tech from #1. Devices should be able to easily communicate and they should be easily controllable by your smart phone. Chromecast is a great model for this. Connects to other devices via WIFI, all of its functionality is controlled via a restful interface. Google glass takes a similar model. I believe it originally used bluetooth but after mobile companies tried to force users to buy a second data plan for it, they adapted it to use WIFI instead.

3) Wearables that do anything OTHER than just be a tiny smartphone on your wrist. Needs to have features that aren&#039;t currently available. Life tracking is my guess. 

4) Cognitive computing, deep learning, big data. Anything that can learn from large amounts of unstructured data without having to have people inject human knowledge into it. You&#039;re going to start seeing more and more of these features in commercial products. Voice recognition, gesture control, object labeling on G+ are all examples of this.

5) As a followup to #4: More nuanced gesture/ voice control. Tighter integration into everyday products.

6) Electric vehicles. It seems like they&#039;ve finally cracked the code on this one. With the Tesla model E coming 2015 look for them to be the company to beat.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, January 7, 2014 at 11:00am PST</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">CES 2014 was completely non inspiring.

Until we get to the point that robots *learn* instead of being programmed to do things, robotics is going to proceed at a withering pace.

One of the advantages humans have is our bodies are 100% covered with sensors (touch, proprioception, pressure, thermoception, pain, equilibrioception). Through that, the brain is easily aware of when mistakes have been made, as well as the severity of them. With current robots, the feed back is limited to general sensors placed in specific locations. As many motion sensors and accelerometers that are placed, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s enough feedback to allow the learning algorithm to properly adjust. And on top of that we already struggle to process all the data it currently is taking in. 

All that being said, even for the robots that are trained by allowing the system to explore it&#039;s environment itself, their algorithms are still not &quot;online&quot; algorithms. Meaning a system that is constantly making predictions and constantly updating their model. For current robotics, when a mistake is detected (mistake detection being a clumsy task already) it&#039;s model has to go into an offline learning stage.

It was very true to what the book was within the constraints it had. It was also beautiful. The Formics looked breathtaking. The acting was amazing. We couldn&#039;t have asked for a better Ender. As a film itself, it had some pacing issue, but that was do to the nature of the book. I was amazed how much stuff it pulled off well that I thought would be difficult to do. As an adaptation of the book probably 9.5 for me. As a film itself probably an 8 just because the story itself doesn&#039;t match a film story arc that well, but it is definitely a very enjoyable watch.

Ketamine best known treatment for a major depressive episode
LSD 7 times more effective than AA at treating alcoholism

It&#039;s interesting that Schedule 1 drugs are listed as having &quot;no medical value&quot; and because of this it&#039;s incredibly difficult to do research on them to determine their medical value. Seems counter intuitive doesn&#039;t it? 

I&#039;m not saying that these drugs can&#039;t be abused, but don&#039;t hinder research.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 20, 2013 at 11:44am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Unforgivable is a word that shouldn&#039;t exist.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, April 19, 2013 at 10:34pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens posted something via YouTube.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, April 19, 2013 at 10:05pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">All I see when I look at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is a 19 year old boy.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, April 19, 2013 at 5:45pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens likes Ray Kurzweil.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, April 19, 2013 at 3:42pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens likes Lauren Cole Norton.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, April 19, 2013 at 10:52am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">I wish I had a puppy to cuddle with right now.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, April 15, 2013 at 5:46pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens posted something via YouTube.</p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, April 14, 2013 at 3:18pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">I haven&#039;t wanted to play a game in a long time, but I REALLY want to play Bioshock Infinite.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 13, 2013 at 4:10pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Retrospective.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 13, 2013 at 4:10pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Retrospective.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 13, 2013 at 4:10pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Retrospective.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 13, 2013 at 4:10pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Retrospective.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 13, 2013 at 4:10pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Retrospective.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 13, 2013 at 4:10pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Retrospective.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 13, 2013 at 4:10pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Retrospective.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, April 13, 2013 at 4:10pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Retrospective.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, April 12, 2013 at 1:58am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Lying in bed thinking about quadratic time complexity.

The brain is deeper than the sea,
For, hold them, blue to blue,

As sponges, buckets do. 

The brain is just the weight of God, 
For, lift them, pound for pound,
And they will differ, if they do,

It just came too early.

I mean, I don&#039;t really want access to the mail out dvd&#039;s, I just want the streaming service and I don&#039;t want to pay more to get something I&#039;m not using.

I think at the time there was still this perception that the difference in available content online vs through dvds was huge. But as they add more and more content online, the value of the mail out service really diminishes in my mind.

Maybe if they had waited until Arrested Development and House of Cards were launched, people would see the online service as a more valuable content platform than the mail out service and they wouldn&#039;t have seen their stock price drop so much.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, February 25, 2013 at 6:02pm PST</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Linus Torvalds to Redhat Developers on Secure Boot Support: &quot;This is not a dick-sucking contest.&quot;

Meaning that if you&#039;re caught downloading copyrighted material 6 times your ISP bans you. This can be avoided by getting a VPN which routes your traffic through another machine. Make sure that if you can&#039;t afford to buy, and still download that you set up access to a VPN on your machine. I recommend AirVPN because they don&#039;t log any of your traffic and it&#039;s pretty cheap but there are a bunch out there.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, February 23, 2013 at 11:41am PST</div>Matt Sevrens added a life event: Got a Car.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, February 23, 2013 at 10:28am PST</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Guy ahead of me is buying only penis shaped foods and condoms.

I guess I can admit to being biased.  I really want to see this phenomenon work.   Does that mean I am going to fake results or deliberately misinterpret or misconstrue data?  No.  Am I going to inadvertently misinterpret data?  Probably, but that&#039;s why I publish the data and welcome the skeptics to keep watching this progress, as well.  Our goal is to make a demonstration experiment that will withstand the critics&#039; arguments.  Succumbing to bias does not get the job done.  Mistaken conclusions don&#039;t heat air or water.  (Actually, if they do I&#039;ll make a new energy source out of them, instead)  But the point is, if it&#039;s not irrefutable, our job isn&#039;t done.  We are very optimistic, but optimism is not the same thing as a working demonstration of a new fire, and we understand the difference.  Once we know how to make a demonstration experiment, then we will welcome double blind studies with researchers and skeptics from all various institutions, every variation of calorimetry that anyone can devise, and anything else that we can do to test it.  What if we never get there?  Then at least we can say we tried. And given the potential importance of this energy source to the world, I feel pretty good about that.&quot; - Martin Fleischmann Memorial Project</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, December 5, 2012 at 10:01am PST</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Timeline Photos.<div class="comment">Enders Game</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, December 4, 2012 at 6:54pm PST</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Timeline Photos.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, December 4, 2012 at 9:38am PST</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">For those interested, the cell was running at over 3 watts for about 8 hours.

I mean... how boring is it that we just are?

But here&#039;s the thing. This will affect you, I guarantee it. This is very literally almost free/ unlimited energy. It would destroy the oil industry. It would make possible devices you never had to plug in. It would make long distance space flight not only possible but easy. This could change everything you know about the world. If it sounds radical that&#039;s because it is. There are a lot of questions to be answered, and a lot of work to be done still. Maybe it wont be as revolutionary as I hope it could be, but it will definitely change some shit. 

If you&#039;re educated about this, if you keep an open ear and eye, just maybe you can be ahead of the game. If I&#039;m wrong about this, I will gladly take a bow and apologize but I swear to fucking god there is something to this shit. Something big.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, November 24, 2012 at 4:06pm PST</div>Matt Sevrens shared a link.<div class="comment">http://data.hugnetlab.com/

The excess heat has been steadily growing for the last few days. Anything over 1 watt could not come from a chemical reaction, it would have to come from nuclear origin. Right now it&#039;s reaching about 1.2, over the next few hours we should see it rise out of the margin of error. 

They did an earlier run where they reached about 8 watts excess power, a very clear sign of non chemical reactions occurring. Of course in these experiments there are so many variables are difficult to control for so they did another set of calibration runs using helium and I would say this data is a lot more reliable. 

Just for sanity, all other things being equal, a run with helium produced no excess power (in fact a net loss) but in hydrogen we&#039;ve seen a steady gain. Any thoughts on where the error would come form? 

Error/ poor experimental design is still under consideration but these results look very promising. It probably wont do much to convince the skeptics, but it&#039;s pushing me from 95% confidence to 99%. 

Questions still to be answered:
1) Is it commercially feasible? 
2) Is it scalable

But I would say we&#039;re very close to being able to check off &quot;is it real&quot; from the list.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, November 24, 2012 at 1:26am PST</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">If theres one thing you should know about me, it&#039;s that I found 7 dollars on the ground today.

I don&#039;t know about you but color me impressed.  

I understand that people are upset that it&#039;s not fast enough, but this could have been a depression, but tell me, are you lining up in a bread line? No so, shut the fuck up that jobs aren&#039;t being created fast enough. We&#039;re not even in a recession anymore, the economy is GROWING, not receding.

In my opinion, it&#039;s pretty clear we&#039;re at the tail end of this thing. It probably doesn&#039;t even matter who ends up in office. But I&#039;d rather choose the guy who did ALL THAT OTHER stuff while actually managing to keep us falling into a depression.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, September 10, 2012 at 6:12pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">47 percent of Ohio Republicans are “not sure” whether Obama or Romney deserves more of the credit for killing Osama Bin Laden. 15% believe Romney deserves more credit.

The first day I went into work, the average time to build/ launch the application was 30 minutes. In actuality, I couldn&#039;t get it up until the second day, and still had many problems, even up until yesterday. 

The crazy thing is, this was normal! The other employees had just accepted it as a way of life. Something you just had to deal with. There were of course hopes to make the process faster, they even hired a bunch of people to come in and figure out how to streamline everything for the whole company.

The point is, every time you wanted to make a change to the code you&#039;d have to recompile, wait 30 minutes and only then (if it worked) could you see the effects. So you&#039;d had to cluster your changes together to be efficient, which makes for very difficult debugging

Today, from first keystroke to page load, I managed to get the build/ deploy process to 1:20. I know it doesn&#039;t sound exciting, but the amount of freedom I just gained is mind numbing. I was trapped by that build. It kept me from being creative, from doing anything that would really represented my skill set. 

So yeah. I&#039;m a little excited about a build process</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 15, 2012 at 11:48pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Timeline Photos.</p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 15, 2012 at 11:03pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">I believe that dogs create a good programming environment...</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 15, 2012 at 10:29pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Timeline Photos.<div class="comment">Yodlee&#039;s net worth graph really puts my financial situation over time into perspective...</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 15, 2012 at 7:18pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Anyone have headphone suggestions?</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, August 15, 2012 at 10:03am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Comment from my coworker regarding social awkwardness: &quot;I wish you could grep people&quot;</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, August 14, 2012 at 8:32pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens likes a link.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, August 14, 2012 at 12:21am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Dat feel when you look in your bank account and see an extra piles of skrillz.

Fusion reactors work by fusing together light elements like hydrogen. These elements  aren&#039;t radioactively unstable and there would be no fear of a nuclear reaction spontaneously occurring. 

A hydrogen bomb is only more destructive than a fission bomb because a fusion reaction is started by a fission reaction. Essentially, a hydrogen bomb works by having one section containing a traditional fission bomb which when ignited causes a secondary section containing both fission and fusion fuel to ignite causing greater destruction. The fusion fuel on its own is completely safe.

But a fusion reactor would never have fissile material in it. It wouldn&#039;t make sense to use fission to try to initiate fusion for power generation. So the idea of a &quot;fusion reactor&quot; giving off radiation or suddenly becoming weaponized is pure stupidity.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, July 23, 2012 at 2:19pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Larry King is doing an AMA on Reddit.

Voters under 30 prefer Obama by a margin of 30 percent. This means the elderly, particularly older white males, are the GOP’s savior. The sole reason that Romney has any chance of winning this fall is that elderly vote in greater numbers than any other voting bloc. In the 2010 mid-term election, 61 percent of the population over the age of 64 voted—compared with just 37 percent of citizens between 25 and 44, and 21 percent of the voting-age population under 25. The GOP would be on the edge of oblivion if the percentage of young and middle-aged people who vote were equal to that of seniors.&quot;</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, July 8, 2012 at 5:21pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens shared a link.</p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, July 8, 2012 at 5:19pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens shared Barack Obama&#039;s photo.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, July 7, 2012 at 11:10am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Mobile Uploads.</p><p><div class="meta">Saturday, July 7, 2012 at 11:00am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Mobile Uploads.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 6, 2012 at 7:29pm PDT</div>Aly Salmon posted a link to your timeline.<div class="comment">new tattoo http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m6pjzxgSl71qbfddao1_500.jpg</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 6, 2012 at 5:44pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens shared a link.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 6, 2012 at 2:55pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Timeline Photos.<div class="comment">Whoa...</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 6, 2012 at 1:49pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Goin&#039; to see my kickass buddy Steve this weekend.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, July 6, 2012 at 11:25am PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">I&#039;ve said it before.

Well shit... that was really good. It&#039;s pretty hard to put into words actually. I think you really need to give it a full listen through. It&#039;s definitely an experience.

The whole album very nuanced and has these wonderful subtle moments. Very textured and layered and the production and songwriting really shine. You can really hear the band in it which is surprising and everyone sounds great. The whole album is sort of a ... lush garden of sound. Very bright and colorful and exotic. Very enjoyable on the whole. 

Definitely looking forward to listening to it again.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Monday, June 11, 2012 at 4:58pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Listening to the new Smashing Pumpkins album Oceania right now, Will post review when done.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, June 10, 2012 at 9:06pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">FUCK TOLLS.

Fucking told you cunts. 

http://futureinnovation.larc.nasa.gov/view/articles/futurism/bushnell/low-energy-nuclear-reactions.html

For those interested, low energy nuclear reactions produce millions of times more energy than chemical reactions and do so in a clean and safe way. It essentially amounts to a complete destruction of the oil industry as well as paving the way towards a future where energy is cheap and easy. Further off in the future, is implementations for interstellar travel. 

Millions of times more energy per reaction means that the amount of fuel you need is much smaller. In fact, the energy in one barrel of LENR &quot;fuel&quot; is equivalent to all of the energy in a supertanker filled with oil. </div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, May 24, 2012 at 6:26pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">It&#039;s disappointing that the earth doesn&#039;t go around the sun in 364 days.

I was waking up at 4pm and sleeping at 7am. I&#039;ve been stuck in a horrible sleep schedule for year. It&#039;s just natural for me to shift later and later.

So I built sync to sunrise. An app designed to gradually shift me towards the gradually shifting sunrise. I&#039;ve simply found that willpower is completely ineffective when it comes to behavioral change. Gradual change and reward is much more effective. Now, I wake up at 9:30 and go to sleep at 1:00 am, and I do this naturally without any will power. My body simply does not allow me to continue sleeping.

I read an article today about just this thing. Behavioral change through apps that use conditioning and gradual change. It&#039;s a great read and represents the core idea of Sync to Sunrise very clearly. I really believe this is where apps are heading. Less games, more tools that can really help individuals. 

Do yourself a favor and check out the article:

When you look at a nutrition label, you will usually see total fat listed (in grams), and trans fat listed in grams. Both trans and saturated fats are bad for you.  What you may not know, is that, if you add together the trans and the saturated fat, and it doesn&#039;t equal the total fat, the rest of the fat in total fat is either mono or polyunsaturated fats which are good for you.

Also of interest, if you see 0g on Trans Fat, that doesn&#039;t mean that there&#039;s no trans fat in the food. It means, that theres less than 0.5 g of Trans fat in the food. Have 0.4 g of fat, 5 times in a day and you&#039;ve reached the max (2g) of Trans fat you should be having each day. 

So, if you see a product, and it doesn&#039;t list Trans Fat whatsoever, that means it actually has no Trans Fat in it.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 23, 2012 at 6:45pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens shared a link.<div class="comment">This song to me embodies the spirit of America.

&quot;Tens of thousands of experiments have now successfully replicated the production of excess heat in multiple types of devices and apparatuses. Several hundred peer-reviewed articles have been published documenting these accomplishments and provide over 70 theories as to why these devices are producing excess heat. In the last five years more than 100 patents have been issued internationally covering a wide variety of inventions capable of producing excess heat from Cold Fusion devices.

I&#039;m currently on the verge of releasing my first app: Sync to Sunrise. Sync to Sunrise has two primary features. 1) To set your alarm to go off at sunrise and 2) To get your alarm to slowly progress towards sunrise, or towards a new personal time.

Sync to Sunrise is about gradually shifting alarms and the power that that has in affecting the inner human clock, our schedules and our wellbeing. 

I&#039;m currently looking for people to test the app before I introduce some new features, and finally release it. If you&#039;ve ever had problems with your sleep schedule and you&#039;re interested in this project please contact me at msevrens&#064;gmail.com</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 9, 2012 at 9:27pm PST</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Killer Headache</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 9, 2012 at 6:42pm PST</div>Matt Sevrens added a new photo to the album Timeline Photos.</p><p><div class="meta">Friday, March 9, 2012 at 5:06pm PST</div>Matt Sevrens shared a link.<div class="comment">re: debugging -

So the entertainment industry tries to slaughter babies and stuff up one of the holes, without realizing that that content is just going to leak out of one of the many many holes. And honestly, the public below has a ton of ways to make new holes.

Oh shit man, I&#039;m so excited to go home and drink some water. Oh man, I&#039;m so excited that I have a refrigerator full of food rather than just rice and beans.

This applies to anything you desire but have yet to obtain. 
If you want a lot of money, if you get it, you will get used to it. 

If you want a lot of sex, if you get it, you will get used to it. 

If you want power, if you get it, you will get used to it.

Suddenly the fantastic becomes mundane and you desire more. 

What we truly desire is the chase. That&#039;s what gets us going. 

If you want someone to want something, take it away from them. 

Liberties, chocolate, internet, sex, money, power, kittens, roads, shoes.

If you want someone to want something, take it away from them.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Sunday, January 22, 2012 at 9:59pm PST</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Republican candidates by delegate counts and by popular vote (in percentage) so far.

A representative is supposed to represent the views and opinions of a group of people. When the majority of the population pushes for something (i.e. net neutrality, non corporate personhood, general reform etc.) and the government pushes back there is something fundamentally wrong. By the people, for the people is a simple concept and when you consider the current resistence to represent the views of the people you have to question if we&#039;re too far removed from the ideals that started this country.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Friday, November 11, 2011 at 11:16pm PST</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">FUCK.

Did I personally give you power over me? No? Then you don&#039;t have it. Sorry. Get over it. You earn respect individual by individual. It&#039;s not a candy bar where you earn the respect of 1000 people and you get the rest of the population free. You have to prove your worth to every person you meet, everyday. Power is not something you earn and therefore deserve to keep. It is given to you, and if you abuse or disrespect that power, those who have given it to you have the right and the responsibility to take it away.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Wednesday, October 19, 2011 at 5:51pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens and Jennifer Elise Nelson are now friends.</p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, October 18, 2011 at 7:27pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens updated his status.<div class="comment">Mylo Xyloto is by far Coldplay&#039;s best album</div></p><p><div class="meta">Tuesday, October 18, 2011 at 4:08pm PDT</div>Matt Sevrens and Carl Kalagorgevich are now friends.</p><p><div class="meta">Monday, October 17, 2011 at 10:39pm PDT</div>Katie Avocado wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">Sorry for responding so Late you&#039;re totally right I suck at the internets.

So when you are driving from the MU bus stop place just call me so that I can punch in the code to lift the bar. And then park between the MU and young hall. The sidewalk is painted white and there should be signs that say Vendor parking.

You got the passes right and my number right? Imma be on campus at 9AM til your performance and will be free to assist you with anything.

That song was awesome. I really liked it because it was really catchy, like pop radio stuff, but with more art. You should record the track so that the quality is a little better. I&#039;m a big fan of guitar, and it probably wouldn&#039;t work for this song but make it more dramatic! Lastly, the lyrics are wonderful, not typical love song, thoughtful. Amazing dude.

&quot;Regarding the future of KDVS events, everyone can expect the same level of quality.  I&#039;ll have a booking style different from Brendan, Mike Leahy, Rick, etc. but I&#039;ll likely incorporate several pieces (you know, maybe some Brendan avant / diversity mixed with Leahy folk here and there) and advice is welcome.  In terms of e-mail contact, everyone can feel free to email me at jasond&#064;sd-dd.com (or this email (jbdunne&#064;ucdavis.edu) forwards to the same place, as will events&#064;kdvs.org very soon), or better yet, talk to me in person or phone me (email for number).  There is certainly no shortage of bands wanting to play in Davis, but feel free to let me know if you really would like to see a band play at the Delta.  And of course the door is still 200% open for any DJ to bring a band in to play in Davis, as Victoria is doing with Griznar, among countless other DJ&#039;s. &quot;

I&#039;m not exactly sure how that works.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, June 21, 2007 at 4:32pm PDT</div>Geoff Mak wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">ugh fuck the word limit.</div></p><p><div class="meta">Thursday, June 21, 2007 at 4:31pm PDT</div>Geoff Mak wrote on your timeline.<div class="comment">I got this e-mail from KDVS:

(C) Regarding the events deal, I&#039;m really curious about that, too. We&#039;ve gotten rather accustomed to emailing Brendan for everything. Now that it&#039;s changed, can we expect the same frequency and quality of events? I&#039;m sure Brendan has had a session with our new coordinator and will still be involved somewhat, but I&#039;d like to have a session, too. I&#039;ve been booking here for 10 years now, and I still get tons of booking inquiries...half of which are worth paying attention to. Which brings up the other half....How are we dealing with these? Some deserve to be ignored completely, such as bands with MySpace spambot software who get dished to G Street, but others deserve to hear &quot;sorry&quot; and &quot;no.&quot; I&#039;ve been hearing about too many bands getting frustrated with booking Davis because of no answers coming back. I catch some of these for Sacto, but many are getting bookings in Humboldt and increasingly Chico and Visalia, or just skipping this region altogether.

But if you could find venues in Sacramento that we could play at, then that&#039;ll be cool.

you are, in fact, a slight jerk and i notice that you didnt deny the face that you&#039;re a violent, key throwing freak HA! you&#039;re just jealous that people love me that much and no one loves you, your negative comments almost ruined my day but then a nice guy at the junction didnt charge me for my odwalla cuz i was having a bad day so now it&#039;s all better. HA!(#2) but that&#039;s beside the point, the point is that you ARE mean to me. every time i see you you do something mean, and it&#039;s not my fault that you were too messed up to understand what was going on cuz i was rather drunk and perfectly understood what was going on.

so, HOORAY for me. :D

alright, there&#039;s really nothing wrong with 6 besides the fact that Ginny needs to respect her elders (i.e. hermione). just because she&#039;s suddenly dating Harry being JKR doesn&#039;t like how popular the draco/harry pairing is getting in fanfiction doesn&#039;t mean she can suddenly start acting like she&#039;s smarter than everyone, especially hermione. haha
and it annoys me when dumb people say snape is evil because of book 6. ...idiots.

and five sucks cuz harry is an emo bitch/angsty teenager. but otherwise i still love HP
